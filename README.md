# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught programmer, I have been learning how to code for more than half a decade and have gained a lot of experience since then. However, I won't claim to know everything about programming, as I believe that there is always something new to learn and improve upon. I am constantly learning and striving to expand my knowledge and skills.
